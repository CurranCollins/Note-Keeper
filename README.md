# Note-Keeper

Note tracker app

## Description

We were assigned a project to write a route.js file and a server.js file so that we could make an app that saves notes. We will have to use node to run server.js to view our finished project. When you click get started you are given a box to enter the title of a note and the note. when you click on the save button the note is saved and added to the database. I learned that one little thing can really mess you up. I had everything working except for the notes showing up and currently there is a bug affecting it.

## Installation

To get this app working I had to download node modules using npm install. I also had to download Heroku in order to deploy the appas asked. The package contained express, and uniqid.

## Usage

When you click the get started button you are taken to a page where you can enter a note and its
title. When you save the notes they are saved to the DB.
